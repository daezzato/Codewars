//There will be a number indicating the amount of hours Nathan is cycling
// It will return the number of liters that Nathan drank. If the value comes out as a decimal, it will need to be rounded to the lowest value.
//1.5 - 1
//I would multiply the number of hours with the amount of water that Nathan drinks in an hour of cycling. Then if the number of liters comes out to a decimal, I will round it down.

//function litres(time) {
  //return Math.floor(time * 0.5)
//}

const litres = time => Math.floor(time * 0.5)
